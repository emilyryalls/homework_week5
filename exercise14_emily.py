# Create a game of rock paper scissors
# The user will play against the computer
# You should design a program that does the following:
# Prompt the user to enter a value: R, P or S
# The programme should convert this value into Rock, Paper or Scissors respectively
# Asks the computer to generate a random value between 0 and 2
# Convert the computer's choice. 0 becomes Rock; 1 becomes Paper; 2 becomes Scissors
# Compare the user's choices with the computer's choice to display a message indicating whether the user won, lost or drew against the computer
# Showcase what you have learned about conditional statements and create your own functions


# Create functions to do the above, and store in a separate file called module_emily
# Then think of loops that will decide what functions needs to be used
# Think about how scores could be stored


input("Input R, P or S:")

# use if statements
# if input is this, covert to this
# then perform computer generated, and then convert it
# print computer output
# another if statement, print diff messages if winning or losing
# loop for more inputs, doesn't need an end -
# refer to pin one for to keep prompting inputs and using while loops
